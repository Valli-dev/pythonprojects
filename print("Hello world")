ATM Mock up with File System as Database
To wrap up our ATM project, we are going to be using python file system as our database.



Follow the instructions as described in this course (videos in this section), and then implement the following:



1. Consistent User Account Balance: When user deposits, withdrawals and do other banking operations, their account balance should be saved in a file. You can create a seperate file for each user, or use the existing user file, or use the same file for all users.

2. When user login to the system, create a file in the auth_session folder to keep track of their login.

3. When user logout of the system, delete the file in auth_session to indicate that they have logged out of the system.



You can find the updated codebase here: https://github.com/xyluz/pythonclass Feel free to fork and clone on your computer to follow along with the tutorial.

When you are done with your implementation, push your work to github and submit URL to the repo.



Looking forward to your work!
